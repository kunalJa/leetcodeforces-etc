Accepted
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Solution Explanation:
    Utilizing Gauss' formula we can figure out the expected sum versus the given sum.
    âˆ‘i where i ranges from 0 to n (inclusive) equals n(n+1) / 2.
    The missing number is this expected value minus the actual sum of nums.

        Solution Explanation:
            Create a hashable datastructure to be able to check the existence
            of an element in O(1) time. Then simply iterate over all number from 0 to n
            (inclusive) and check whether or not that number exists in the set.
